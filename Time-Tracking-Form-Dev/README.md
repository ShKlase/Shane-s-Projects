Time Tracking Dashboard

Project Type: Frontend Mentor Challenge
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Description
This is a dynamic time tracking dashboard inspired by the Frontend Mentor challenge. The dashboard displays current and previous hours spent on different activities such as Work, Play, Study, Exercise, Social, and Self Care. Users can switch between daily, weekly, and monthly views using the buttons at the top.

⚠️ Note: This project is not fully finished. Most features and styles are still in progress.

Features:
 - Dynamic Rendering: Uses JavaScript to render activity cards based on selected timeframe (daily, weekly, monthly).
 - Timeframe Switching: Clicking a button updates all activity cards with relevant data.
- Reusable Data Structure: Activity data stored in a single JavaScript array of objects for easy updates.
- Responsive Layout: Basic structure supports multiple activity cards in a dashboard format.

Known Issues:
Currently, the UI and CSS are incomplete.
Some cards may not align properly on smaller screens.
Activity card generation is functional, but not all interactive or visual effects are implemented.
Some accessibility features are missing.
Future Improvements
Add hover effects and more polished styling for cards.
Ensure fully responsive design across devices.
Implement animations for switching between timeframes.
Add persistent state using local storage or user preferences.
