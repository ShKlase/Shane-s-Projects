Project Name: Calculator App

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Description:
A fully interactive Calculator App that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with a clean, responsive interface. The app supports live number formatting, decimal input, delete and reset functionality, and dynamic theme switching across three color themes.

Key Features & Learnings:
 - Implemented real-time DOM updates to display the current calculation as users interact with buttons.
 - Handled user input validation for numbers, operators, and decimal points.

 - Built modular JavaScript functions for reusable logic, including formatting numbers with commas, applying themes, and handling arithmetic operations.

 - Implemented theme switching using CSS and JavaScript to dynamically update colors and button styles.

 - Gained experience in event delegation and managing multiple event listeners efficiently.

 - Debugged floating-point precision and edge cases, including handling empty inputs, consecutive operators, and division by zero.

How to Use:
1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Click on the number buttons to input values.
3. Use the arithmetic operator buttons (+, -, x, /) to perform operations.
4. Press . to add a decimal point.
5. Use DEL to delete the last input or RESET to clear the calculation.
6. Press = to evaluate the expression.
7. Adjust the theme using the slider at the top to switch between three different visual themes.
