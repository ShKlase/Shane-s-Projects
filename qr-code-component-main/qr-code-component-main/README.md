Project Name: QR Code Component

Tech Used: HTML, CSS

Description:
This was my first-ever web development project, a simple yet foundational exercise in building and styling a static webpage using pure HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to recreate a clean QR code card layout similar to the Frontend Mentor “QR Component” challenge. It helped me understand essential web development concepts such as the box model, alignment, spacing, and responsive design basics. The page displays a centered QR code with a short headline and paragraph encouraging users to scan the code and visit Frontend Mentor. The focus was on achieving proper layout balance, visual hierarchy, and readable typography using the Outfit Google Font.

Key Features & Learnings:
 - First Project Experience: Gained hands-on familiarity with HTML structure and semantic tags.
 - Basic CSS Styling: Learned how to use margins, padding, borders, and flexbox for element positioning.
 - Font and Icon Integration: Linked Google Fonts and a favicon for better visual polish.
 - Responsive Centering: Ensured the component remains centered and visually appealing across different screen sizes.
- Clean Code Practices: Practiced separating structure (HTML) from styling (CSS) for better maintainability.

How to Use:
1. Open index.html in your web browser.
2. The page will display a centered QR code card.
3. Scan the QR code to visit the Frontend Mentor site.

Difficulty:
Beginner — Ideal for understanding web page structure, static layouts, and fundamental CSS styling.
