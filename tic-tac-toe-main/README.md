Project Name: Tic Tac Toe Game

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Description:
An interactive Tic Tac Toe game with two modes: Player vs Player and Player vs CPU. Players can choose their mark (X or O), and the game dynamically updates the board, tracks scores, and displays a win/draw screen. This project emphasizes DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic, and dynamic UI updates. It was my first attempt (I think) at creating a fully interactive web-based game.

Key Features & Learnings:
 - Player Selection: Pick X or O before starting the game.
 - Game Modes: Supports Player vs Player and Player vs CPU.
 - Dynamic Board Updates: Clicking a square updates the board and tracks turns.
 - Win/Draw Detection: Automatically detects wins, draws, and highlights winning combinations.
 - Score Tracking: Keeps track of X wins, O wins, and ties across rounds.
 - Round Management: Options for restarting the round or quitting the game.
 - First Interactive Project: Reinforced JavaScript logic, event-driven programming, and DOM manipulation.

How to Use:
1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Select X or O as Player 1’s mark.
3. Choose either VS CPU or VS Player mode.
4. Click on squares to place your mark.
5. The game will automatically display a win/draw message and update scores.
6. Use Restart or Next Round buttons to continue playing.

Difficulty:
Intermediate — Combines structured HTML/CSS layout with advanced JavaScript logic, event handling, and interactive gameplay.

Known Issues / Notes: 
CPU logic is basic and may not always block winning moves.
Color of x's/o's are not always correct.
