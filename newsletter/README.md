Project Name: Newsletter Sign-Up Form with Success Message

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Description:
A responsive newsletter sign-up form that validates user email input and provides a confirmation screen upon successful submission. The project mimics a real-world user subscription flow with clear feedback for errors and success. JavaScript is used to dynamically switch between the input form and a thank-you message screen.

Key Features & Learnings:
 - Implemented real-time email validation using regular expressions (emailRegex).
 - Used conditional DOM manipulation to show or hide form elements and error messages dynamically.
 - Practiced event handling by capturing and preventing the default form submission behavior.
 -  Applied visual feedback through CSS classes like hide and input-error for seamless user experience.
 - Designed a confirmation message screen (container2) that replaces the main sign-up section (container1) after successful validation.
 - Strengthened understanding of form validation logic, class toggling, and responsive HTML structure for accessibility and clarity.

How to Use:
1. Open index.html in a web browser.
2. Enter your email address in the input field.
3. Click “Subscribe to monthly newsletter.”
4. If the email format is invalid, an inline “Valid email required” message will appear.
5. Once a valid email is submitted, the form disappears, and a thank-you message is displayed.
